 If set to 1, the ZA density field is additionally smoothed (asside from the implicit
 boxcar smoothing performed when re-binning the ICs from DIM to HII_DIM) with a Gaussian
 filter of width 0.2*BOX_LEN/HII_DIM.  The implicit boxcar smoothing in perturb_field.c
 bins the density field on scale DIM/HII_DIM, similar to what Lagrangian codes do
 when constructing Eulerian grids. In other words, the density field, \delta,
 is quantized into (DIM/HII_DIM)^3 values. If your usage requires smooth density fields,
 it is recommended to set SMOOTH_EVOLVED_FIELD to 1.  This also decreases the shot noise
 present in all grid based codes, though it overcompensates by an effective loss in resolution.

 in mostly ionized unverses, so only use for lower resolution boxes (HII_DIM<~400)

 which dominates the collapse fraction field on small scales (i.e. where the mean halo number
 is small).  However, option (0) is faster as it bypasses the halo finder, and it becomes
 increasingly accurate as the typical bubble size increases.

 then Poisson scatter is added to mimic discrete halos on the subgrid scale
 (see Zahn+ 2010).

 it is recommended to turn off this feature, as halos can stocastically

 a good approximation at the <~10% level.  Future builds will include the mao+ model for
